## Portable use

To use bmrec without installing it,after extracting it,open terminal and

## Permission denied

This error occures when the user does not have enough privileges to access the program.

In this case,we need to get ownership of the app by typing :

```bash
$ chmod +x /bin/bmrec

$ chmod +x /opt/bmrec.jar
```

or if you run bmrec as portable :
